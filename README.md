# ASP.NET-WebAPI-Code-First-Approach-Sample-Project
This is a Sample ASP.NET project created using Code First Approach and implemented using Swagger.

In this project:
The "Entities" folder holds the classes to create Database Tables and their Foreign key relations.
This folder also holds the modelContext class for DbContext (concept of Entity Framework Core).
The "Models" folder holds the views of data that we want to be displayed to the user.
The "Repositories" folder has been created to hold opertaions to be performed by the user.
The "Controllers" folder holds the controllers for classes to be displayed on Swagger UI.
Controllers call the methods generated in the repositories.

Thanks!
